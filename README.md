# ⭐ Awesome Tools I Like

A list of tools and projects that I find awesome.

These aren't necessarily:

- The most popular
- The best tools
- A comprehensive list of every tool that I use

But rather they are tools that I want to highlight because I think they are awesome.

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### 📝 Documentation & Presentations

- [Marp](https://marp.app/) - I love being able to write presentations in Markdown. Simple and version-control friendly.
- [Markwhen](https://markwhen.com/) - Markdown for things that happen over time. Great for project planning and documentation.

### 🏷️ Versioning

- [Trunkver](https://trunkver.dev) - Automated versioning for continuously delivered applications. It's a SemVer-compatible versioning scheme that takes the thought out of versioning.
